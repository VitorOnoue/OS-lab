## Compiling C programs
Once you have GCC installed, compiling a C program could be done with this command:

```
gcc [file_name].c -o [program_name]
```

If you haven't installed GCC yet, this might help: https://gcc.gnu.org/install/

## Running C programs
After compiling the program, run the following command in the terminal:

```
./[program_name]
```
